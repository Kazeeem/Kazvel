# Kazvel
This is a mini-framework. It should only be used for small website projects. If your project is a big project, please use Laravel not Kazvel.

For now, this will work only for Static sites that needs no database functionality.

You are free to contribute, just create a pull request and briefly describe what contribution it contains.

~ P.S: THIS IS JUST A SMALL FRAMEWORK, IT'S GOAL IS NOT TO COMPETE WITH WELL ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORKS LIKE LARAVEL. IT'S JUST FOR PRACTICE AND CAN BE USED TO CREATE SMALL WEBSITES.

Features To Add:

* Flexible/more readable route
* Database functionality. Preferably ORM (Of course)
* Authentication Functionality
* That's all for now, we add more when the need arises.
